**Flow:**
```
Sarah submits $500 expense
  ↓
John sees in Approval Queue:
  • Pending (1)
  • Expense card shows: Sequence 1, PENDING
  ↓
John clicks card:
  • Reviews details

  • Adds comment: "Approved"
  ↓
John clicks "Approve"
  ↓
Result:
  • Expense status: APPROVED ✓
  • Request moves to John's "Processed" tab
  • Sarah receives notification
```

### Scenario 2: Multi-Level with Percentage Rule

**Setup:**
- Employee: Sarah
- Manager: John (isManagerApprover = true)
- Rule 1: Finance Team (60%, 3 approvers)

**Flow:**
```
Sarah submits $2,000 expense
  ↓
John (Sequence 1) approves
  ↓
Finance Team sees in Approval Queue:
  • All 3 see same expense
  • Card shows: Sequence 2, PENDING
  • "Your Turn" badge visible
  ↓
Finance Manager A clicks card:
  • Sees approval chain:
    ✓ Seq 1: John - APPROVED
    ⏳ Seq 2: Finance Team - PENDING
      • Finance A: PENDING (You)
      • Finance B: PENDING
      • Finance C: PENDING
    (Need 60% - Currently 0%)
  ↓
Finance A approves
  ↓
Finance Manager B sees update:
  • Sees approval chain:
    ✓ Seq 1: John - APPROVED
    ⏳ Seq 2: Finance Team - PENDING
      • Finance A: APPROVED ✓
      • Finance B: PENDING (You)
      • Finance C: PENDING
    (Need 60% - Currently 33%)
  ↓
Finance B approves
  ↓
Result:
  • 2 of 3 = 66% ≥ 60% → Condition met!
  • Expense status: APPROVED ✓
  • Finance C request auto-completed
  • All move to "Processed" tab
  • Sarah receives notification
```

### Scenario 3: Hybrid Rule (CFO Override)

**Setup:**
- Employee: Sarah
- Rule 1: Hybrid (60% OR CFO)
  - 3 Finance Managers + 1 CFO

**Flow:**
```
Sarah submits $10,000 expense
  ↓
All 4 approvers see in Approval Queue:
  • Card shows: Sequence 1, PENDING
  ↓
CFO clicks card:
  • Sees: "Special Approver" badge
  • Knows: "Your approval auto-approves"
  ↓
CFO approves
  ↓
Result:
  • CFO is special approver → Instant approval!
  • Expense status: APPROVED ✓
  • All requests move to "Processed"
  • Finance team requests auto-completed
  • Sarah receives notification
  
Alternative flow if Finance approves first:

  Finance B approves (66% ≥ 60%)
