# üöÄ Sequential Approval Workflow Implementation

## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED FEATURES**

### üìã **Core Approval Workflow**

#### **1. Sequential Approval Chain**

- **Manager Approval First**: When `isManagerApprover` is checked for an employee's manager, they are the first approver (Sequence 1)
- **Rule-Based Approval**: After manager approval, the system follows defined approval rules in sequence
- **Sequential Processing**: Expense moves to next approver only after current one approves/rejects

#### **2. Multi-Level Approval Rules**

Supports three rule types:

##### **üéØ PERCENTAGE Rules**

- Requires X% of assigned approvers to approve
- Example: "Finance team needs 60% approval"
- All approvers at this level vote simultaneously
- If conditions can't be met (not enough pending votes), auto-rejects

##### **üëë SPECIFIC_APPROVER Rules**

- Requires approval from specific designated approvers
- Example: "Only Director can approve"
- Only special approvers can approve at this level
- If all special approvers reject/respond negatively, auto-rejects

##### **üîÑ HYBRID Rules**

- Combines PERCENTAGE OR SPECIFIC_APPROVER logic
- Example: "Either 75% of finance team OR CFO approval"
- Flexible approval conditions
- First satisfied condition approves the expense

#### **3. Advanced Workflow Logic**

##### **Smart Rejection Handling**

- Any rejection at current sequence level = immediate expense rejection
- All pending approvals at same sequence auto-rejected
- Prevents unnecessary workflow continuation

##### **Conditional Progression**

- System evaluates approval conditions after each approval
- Automatically moves to next sequence when conditions met
- Final approval when all sequences completed

##### **Real-time Status Updates**

- Instant notification system for all state changes
- Approval requests updated in real-time
- Dashboard reflects current workflow status

## üèóÔ∏è **TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **Database Schema**

```sql
-- Core approval workflow tables
ApprovalRule {
  id: String (Primary Key)
  name: String
  ruleType: PERCENTAGE | SPECIFIC_APPROVER | HYBRID
  percentage: Int? (for PERCENTAGE/HYBRID rules)
  sequence: Int (determines order)
  isActive: Boolean
}

ApprovalRuleApprover {
  approvalRuleId: String (Foreign Key)
  userId: String (Foreign Key)
  isSpecialApprover: Boolean (for SPECIFIC_APPROVER/HYBRID)
  sequence: Int
}

ApprovalRequest {
  expenseId: String (Foreign Key)
  approverId: String (Foreign Key)
  status: PENDING | APPROVED | REJECTED
  sequence: Int (workflow step)
  comments: String?
}
```

### **API Endpoints**

```
GET  /api/approval-requests     # Get pending approvals for current user
PATCH /api/expenses/[id]/approve # Approve/reject with workflow logic
GET  /api/expenses              # Enhanced with approval chain data
```

## üìä **WORKFLOW EXAMPLES**

### **Example 1: Simple Manager ‚Üí Finance Workflow**

```
Step 1: Manager (if isManagerApprover = true)
Step 2: Finance Team (60% approval rule)
Step 3: Auto-approve when conditions met
```

### **Example 2: Complex Multi-Level Workflow**

```
Step 1: Direct Manager (isManagerApprover = true)
Step 2: Department Head (Specific Approver rule)
Step 3: Finance Team (75% approval rule)
Step 4: CFO (Hybrid: CFO OR 90% of senior management)
```

### **Example 3: High-Value Expense Workflow**

```
Step 1: Manager (isManagerApprover = true)
Step 2: Finance (HYBRID: 60% OR Finance Director)
Step 3: Executive Team (PERCENTAGE: 51%)
Step 4: CEO (SPECIFIC_APPROVER: CEO only)
```

## üîß **CONFIGURATION GUIDE**

### **Setting Up Approval Rules**

1. **Create Approval Rule**

   ```typescript
   {
     name: "Finance Approval",
     ruleType: "PERCENTAGE",
     percentage: 60,
     sequence: 2, // After manager
     isActive: true
   }
   ```

2. **Assign Approvers**

   ```typescript
   {
     approvalRuleId: "rule_id",
     userId: "user_id",
     isSpecialApprover: false, // true for SPECIFIC_APPROVER rules
     sequence: 1
   }
   ```

3. **Enable Manager Approval**
   ```typescript
   User {
     isManagerApprover: true // This manager will be first approver
   }
   ```
