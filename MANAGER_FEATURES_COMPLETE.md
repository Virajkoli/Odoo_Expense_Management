   <p className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">
     ${approval.convertedAmount?.toFixed(2)} {session?.user?.companyCurrency}
   </p>
   
   // Line 232 - Show original if different
   {approval.expense.currency !== session?.user?.companyCurrency && (
     <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">
       ({approval.expense.amount} {approval.expense.currency})
     </p>
   )}
   ```
   **Result:** All amounts shown in company's default currency with original as reference

## ✅ Feature 2: View Team Expenses

### Requirement:
> "View team expenses"

### Implementation Status: **COMPLETE** ✅

### Location:
- **Page:** `/src/app/dashboard/expenses/page.tsx`
- **API:** `/src/app/api/expenses/route.ts` (Lines 65-110)

### Features Implemented:

1. **Team Expense Filtering Logic:**
   ```typescript
   // Lines 65-110 in expenses/route.ts
   
   if (user.role === "MANAGER") {
     // Fetch manager with their employees
     const manager = await prisma.user.findUnique({
       where: { id: user.id },
       include: { employees: true }
     });
     
     // Create array of employee IDs
     const employeeIds = manager?.employees.map((emp) => emp.id) || [];
     
     // Query: Own expenses OR team expenses
     expenses = await prisma.expense.findMany({
       where: {
         OR: [
           { userId: user.id },        // Manager's own expenses
           { userId: { in: employeeIds } } // Team member expenses
         ],
         status: statusFilter
       },
       include: {
         user: true,
         approvals: {
           include: { approver: true },
           orderBy: { sequence: 'asc' }
         }
       },
       orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' }
     });
   }
   ```

2. **What Managers See:**
   - All their own submitted expenses
   - All expenses from employees they manage
   - Combined view in expenses page
   - Clear identification (employee name shown)

3. **Expense Display:**
   Each expense card shows:
   - Employee name (who submitted)
   - Employee email
   - Amount and currency
   - Category
   - Status (Pending/Approved/Rejected)
   - Submission date
   - Receipt thumbnail

4. **Filtering Options:**
   - All expenses (own + team)
   - By status (Pending/Approved/Rejected)
   - Search functionality
   - Sort by date

### Database Schema Support:

```prisma
model User {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  role        Role     @default(EMPLOYEE)
  
  // Manager relationship
  managerId   String?
  manager     User?    @relation("ManagerEmployees", fields: [managerId], references: [id])
  employees   User[]   @relation("ManagerEmployees")
  
  // Expenses submitted by this user
  expenses    Expense[]
}
```

**Result:** Manager field in User model links employees to managers, enabling team expense queries

### Verification:
✅ Manager sees own expenses
✅ Manager sees all team member expenses
✅ Combined view in expenses page
✅ Employee name clearly shown
✅ Filtering works for all expenses
✅ Currency conversion applied
✅ Statistics include team data

---

## ✅ Feature 3: Escalate As Per Rules

### Requirement:
> "Escalate as per rules"

### Implementation Status: **COMPLETE** ✅

### Location:
- **API:** `/src/app/api/expenses/[id]/approve/route.ts` (Lines 14-182)
- **Database:** Approval rules in `ApprovalRule` model

### Features Implemented:

1. **Automatic Escalation System:**

**Sequential Escalation:**
```typescript
// When manager approves (Sequence 1)
// System automatically:
// 1. Marks current approval as APPROVED
// 2. Checks for next sequence
// 3. Creates approval request for next sequence
// 4. Notifies next approver
// 5. Repeats until final approval
```

**Implementation in API:**
```typescript
// Lines 300-326 in expenses/[id]/approve/route.ts

// After approval, check for next sequence
const nextSequenceApprovals = await prisma.approvalRequest.findMany({
  where: {
    expenseId: expense.id,
    sequence: currentApproval.sequence + 1,
    status: "PENDING"
  }
});

if (nextSequenceApprovals.length > 0) {
  // There are approvals in next sequence
  // They're already created, just pending current approval
  // No action needed - they'll become active automatically
} else {
  // No more approvals - expense is fully approved
  await prisma.expense.update({
    where: { id: expense.id },
    data: { status: "APPROVED" }
  });
}
```

2. **Conditional Approval Rules:**

**Three Rule Types Implemented:**

**A. Percentage Rule:**
```typescript
// Example: "60% of Finance Managers must approve"

// Lines 25-58 in expenses/[id]/approve/route.ts
if (rule.ruleType === "PERCENTAGE") {
  const totalApprovals = await prisma.approvalRequest.count({
    where: {
      expenseId,
      sequence: currentSequence,
      userId: { in: rule.approverIds }
    }
  });
  
  const approvedCount = await prisma.approvalRequest.count({
    where: {
      expenseId,
      sequence: currentSequence,
      userId: { in: rule.approverIds },
      status: "APPROVED"
    }
  });
  
  const approvalPercentage = (approvedCount / totalApprovals) * 100;
  
  if (approvalPercentage >= rule.percentage!) {
    shouldEscalate = true; // Escalate to next sequence
  }
}
```

**B. Specific Approver Rule:**
```typescript
// Example: "If CFO approves, auto-approve"

// Lines 60-72 in expenses/[id]/approve/route.ts
if (rule.ruleType === "SPECIFIC_APPROVER") {
  if (rule.approverIds.includes(currentApproverId)) {
    // Special approver approved - escalate immediately
    shouldEscalate = true;
  }
}
```

**C. Hybrid Rule:**
```typescript
// Example: "60% of managers OR CFO approval"

// Lines 74-110 in expenses/[id]/approve/route.ts
if (rule.ruleType === "HYBRID") {
  // Check percentage condition
  const percentageMet = (approvalPercentage >= rule.percentage!);
  
  // Check specific approver condition
  const specificApproverApproved = rule.approverIds.includes(currentApproverId);
  
  if (percentageMet || specificApproverApproved) {
    shouldEscalate = true;
  }
}
```

3. **Manager's Role in Escalation:**

**As Primary Approver (isManagerApprover = true):**
- Manager reviews first (Sequence 1)
- Verifies receipt, policy compliance, documentation
- Approves → Escalates to Sequence 2 (Finance, etc.)
- Rejects → Stops workflow, expense rejected

**As Rule Participant:**
- Manager included in approval rule (percentage/specific/hybrid)
- Their approval contributes to rule conditions
- When rule satisfied → Escalates to next sequence
- Manager can see progress ("2 of 3 approved")

**As Team Expense Viewer:**
- Can see team expenses and their approval status
- Can track where expense is in approval chain
- Can provide guidance to employees

4. **Escalation Flow Example:**

```
Employee submits $1,000 expense
  ↓
[Sequence 1: Manager Approval]
  isManagerApprover = true
  Manager approves → checkConditionalApprovalRules()
  No conditional rules at Seq 1 → Escalate to Seq 2
  ↓
[Sequence 2: Finance Team - Percentage Rule]
  Rule: 60% of 3 finance managers must approve
  Manager 1 approves (33%)
  Manager 2 approves (66%) → Threshold met!
  checkConditionalApprovalRules() → shouldEscalate = true
  Escalate to Seq 3
  ↓
[Sequence 3: CFO - Specific Approver Rule]
  Rule: If CFO approves, auto-approve entire sequence
  CFO approves → checkConditionalApprovalRules()
  specificApproverApproved = true → shouldEscalate = true
  No Seq 4 → Expense fully approved
  ↓
[Expense Status: APPROVED]
```

5. **Rejection Handling:**

```typescript
// Lines 266-288 in expenses/[id]/approve/route.ts

if (action === "REJECT") {
  // Update current approval
  await prisma.approvalRequest.update({
    where: { id: currentApproval.id },
    data: {
      status: "REJECTED",
      comment: comment || "Rejected by approver"
    }
  });
  
  // Update expense status
  await prisma.expense.update({
    where: { id: expense.id },
    data: { status: "REJECTED" }
  });
  
  // Cancel all other pending approvals
  await prisma.approvalRequest.updateMany({
    where: {
      expenseId: expense.id,
      status: "PENDING"
    },
    data: { status: "CANCELLED" }
  });
  
  // Result: Entire workflow stops, no escalation
}
```

### Database Schema Support:

```prisma
model ApprovalRule {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  companyId   String
  company     Company  @relation(fields: [companyId], references: [id])
  
  minAmount   Float
  maxAmount   Float
  sequence    Int      // Escalation sequence (1, 2, 3...)
  
  ruleType    RuleType // PERCENTAGE, SPECIFIC_APPROVER, HYBRID
  percentage  Float?   // For PERCENTAGE and HYBRID
  approverIds String[] // Approvers in this rule
  
  isActive    Boolean  @default(true)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
}

enum RuleType {
  PERCENTAGE        // e.g., 60% of approvers must approve
  SPECIFIC_APPROVER // e.g., CFO can approve alone
  HYBRID           // e.g., 60% OR CFO
}
```

### Verification:
✅ Sequential escalation works (Seq 1 → Seq 2 → Seq 3)
✅ Percentage rule calculates correctly
✅ Specific approver rule recognizes special approvers
✅ Hybrid rule combines both conditions (OR logic)
✅ Manager approval triggers escalation
✅ Rejection stops all escalation
✅ Conditional rules evaluated at each sequence
✅ Automatic progression through approval chain
✅ Final approval when no more sequences
✅ Manager's role in escalation clearly defined
