## 📊 Database Schema Overview

```
Company
├── Users (Admin, Manager, Employee)
│   ├── Expenses
│   │   └── ApprovalRequests
│   └── Manager relationship
└── ApprovalRules
    └── ApprovalRuleApprovers
```

## 🎯 Core Workflows

### 1. Signup Flow
1. User signs up with email, password, name, country, company name
2. System fetches country currency from Countries API
3. Creates Company with currency
4. Creates Admin User
5. Redirects to dashboard

### 2. Expense Submission Flow
1. Employee submits expense with details
2. System converts currency if needed (ExchangeRate API)
3. Creates expense record
4. Checks for manager approval (if isManagerApprover)
5. Creates approval request(s)
6. Sends notifications (future)

### 3. Approval Flow
1. Manager/Admin sees pending approvals
2. Reviews expense details
3. Approves or Rejects with comments
4. System updates expense status
5. If approved and more approvers, moves to next
6. If final approval, marks expense as APPROVED
