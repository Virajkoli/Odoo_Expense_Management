# Approval Workflow - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status

### Completed Features

#### 1. Manager Approval ‚úì
- **Location:** `/src/app/api/expenses/route.ts` (Lines 211-221)
- **Logic:** Checks if `user.manager.isManagerApprover === true`
- **Sequence:** Always sequence 1 (if enabled)
- **Compliance:** ‚úì "The expense is first approved by his manager, if the IS MANAGER APPROVER field is checked"

#### 2. Multi-Level Sequential Approvals ‚úì
- **Location:** `/src/app/api/expenses/route.ts` (Lines 223-286)
- **Logic:** Processes active approval rules in order by `rule.sequence`
- **Sequence:** Increments after each rule (2, 3, 4...)
- **Compliance:** ‚úì "When multiple approvers are assigned, Admin can define their sequence"

#### 3. Percentage Rule ‚úì
- **Location:** `/src/app/api/expenses/[id]/approve/route.ts` (Lines 105-117)
- **Logic:** Calculates `(approved / total) * 100`, checks against `rule.percentage`
- **Example:** 60% rule with 5 approvers needs 3 approvals
- **Compliance:** ‚úì "If 60% of approvers approve ‚Üí Expense approved"

#### 4. Specific Approver Rule ‚úì
- **Location:** `/src/app/api/expenses/[id]/approve/route.ts` (Lines 119-145)
- **Logic:** Checks if any `isSpecialApprover` has approved
- **Example:** CFO approval instantly moves to next sequence
- **Compliance:** ‚úì "If CFO approves ‚Üí Expense auto-approved"

#### 5. Hybrid Rule ‚úì
- **Location:** `/src/app/api/expenses/[id]/approve/route.ts` (Lines 147-180)
- **Logic:** Checks percentage OR special approver (OR condition)
- **Example:** 60% of team OR CFO approval
- **Compliance:** ‚úì "Combine both (e.g., 60% OR CFO approves)"

#### 6. Sequential Processing ‚úì
- **Location:** `/src/app/api/expenses/[id]/approve/route.ts` (Lines 300-326)
- **Logic:** Only processes current sequence, moves to next only when conditions met
- **Flow:** Sequence 1 ‚Üí Approve ‚Üí Sequence 2 ‚Üí Approve ‚Üí Final Approval
- **Compliance:** ‚úì "Expense moves to the next approver only after the current one approves"

#### 7. Rejection Handling ‚úì
- **Location:** `/src/app/api/expenses/[id]/approve/route.ts` (Lines 266-288)
- **Logic:** Any rejection immediately rejects expense, stores comment
- **Auto-reject:** All pending requests at same sequence auto-rejected
- **Compliance:** ‚úì "Approve/Reject with comments"

#### 8. Combined Flows ‚úì
- **Location:** `/src/app/api/expenses/route.ts` (Full workflow)
- **Logic:** Manager (seq 1) + Rule 1 (seq 2) + Rule 2 (seq 3) + Rule 3 (seq 4)...
- **Example:** Manager ‚Üí Finance Team (60%) ‚Üí CFO (specific) ‚Üí Director (specific)
- **Compliance:** ‚úì "There can be a combination of both flows together"

## üîß Implementation Details

### Database Schema

```prisma
model ApprovalRule {
  id          String              @id
  name        String
  companyId   String
  ruleType    ApprovalRuleType    // PERCENTAGE | SPECIFIC_APPROVER | HYBRID
  percentage  Int?                // Required for PERCENTAGE and HYBRID
  sequence    Int                 // Execution order (1, 2, 3...)
  isActive    Boolean             // Can be toggled on/off
  approvers   ApprovalRuleApprover[]
}

model ApprovalRuleApprover {
  id                String  @id
  approvalRuleId    String
  userId            String
  isSpecialApprover Boolean // true for CFO in SPECIFIC_APPROVER/HYBRID rules
  sequence          Int     // Order within the rule
}

model ApprovalRequest {
  id         String         @id
  expenseId  String
  approverId String
  status     ApprovalStatus // PENDING | APPROVED | REJECTED
  sequence   Int            // Which approval level (1, 2, 3...)
  comments   String?
}
```

### API Endpoints

#### 1. Create Expense with Approval Workflow
```
POST /api/expenses
Body: { amount, currency, category, description, date, receipt }
Returns: Expense with approval requests created
```

**Implementation:**
1. Creates expense record
2. Checks for manager approval requirement
3. Fetches active approval rules (ordered by sequence)
4. Creates approval requests for each level
5. Returns expense

#### 2. Approve/Reject Expense
```
PATCH /api/expenses/[id]/approve
Body: { status: "APPROVED" | "REJECTED", comments?: string }
Returns: { message, status }
```

**Implementation:**
1. Finds pending approval request for current user
2. Updates request status
3. If REJECTED ‚Üí Reject expense, cancel all pending at same sequence
4. If APPROVED ‚Üí Check conditional rules:
   - Rules satisfied ‚Üí Move to next sequence or final approval
   - Rules not satisfied ‚Üí Keep pending
   - Rules impossible ‚Üí Reject expense

## üöÄ Ready to Test

The approval workflow is **fully implemented** and ready for testing. To test:

1. **Create test users:**
   ```bash
   # From Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Users
   - Create managers
   - Create employees
   - Set manager relationships
   - Toggle isManagerApprover flag
   ```

2. **Configure approval rules:**
   ```bash
   # From Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Approval Rules
   - Create percentage rule (e.g., 60%)
   - Create specific approver rule (CFO)
   - Create hybrid rule (60% OR CFO)
   - Set sequences (1, 2, 3...)
   - Mark special approvers
   ```

3. **Submit test expense:**
   ```bash
   # From Employee account
   POST /api/expenses
   {
     "amount": 1000,
     "originalCurrency": "USD",
     "category": "Travel",
     "description": "Business trip",
     "expenseDate": "2025-10-04T10:00:00Z"
   }
   ```

4. **Approve in sequence:**
   ```bash
   # From Manager/Approver accounts
   PATCH /api/expenses/[id]/approve
   {
     "status": "APPROVED",
     "comments": "Approved"
   }
   ```

5. **Verify workflow:**
   ```bash
   # Check:
   - Approval requests created in correct sequence
   - Percentage calculations working
   - Special approver override working
   - Sequential progression working
   - Final approval/rejection working
   ```
